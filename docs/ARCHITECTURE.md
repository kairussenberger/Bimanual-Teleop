The hand path is parallel: raw landmarks → `hands/quest_retarget` → 17 ORCA joint
degrees (never goes through arm IK).

## The Mapping Contracts (CLAUDE.md is normative)

- **Position — absolute, body-anchored.** Robot chest = your torso. Live
  transports require an in-session GUIDED CALIBRATION (`vr/neutral_calib.py`,
  three held poses: rest → clap → extended-forward LAST): per-axis scale, the
  clap-anchored lateral curve, and an offset that absorbs the ORBIT recenter
  anchors — the wrist and head streams anchor INDEPENDENTLY, metres apart in
  practice, so the fitted offset is NEVER clipped. `vr.torso_from_head` and
  `mapping.pos_scale` remain the static knobs.
- **Orientation — absolute, calibration-free.** The robot hand WEARS the
  operator's hand attitude through fixed conventions (see CLAUDE.md). No
  stance calibration ever; `vr.calib_seconds` defaults to 0 (the old 5 s hold
  is legacy).
- Proven on a real recorded session via `scripts/analyze_session.py`:
  orientation axis error 1.4° median, absolute position correspondence 0.1 cm
  median; the calibration fit lands the held extended pose within 1.5 cm of
  the robot neutral (replayed from a real session).

## Failsafe Inventory (every layer, where it lives, how it's tested)

| # | Failsafe | Layer | Behavior | Test |
|---|----------|-------|----------|------|
| 1 | Staleness gate | `safety/supervisor.py` | VR sample older than `safety.staleness_s` ⇒ not engaged | `test_supervisor_estop_and_staleness` |
| 2 | Dropout HOLD | supervisor | brief tracking loss ⇒ hold last pose ≤ `hold_s`, then idle (never chases a frozen target) | same |
| 3 | Deadman release | supervisor + clutch | releasing the clutch on a LIVE feed disengages immediately | `test_clutch_release_disengages_immediately` |
| 4 | Latched e-stop | supervisor | zeros engagement until deliberate `reset()`; run_hw releases torque on exit | same |
| 5 | Fail-closed parsing | sources + calibrate | malformed/non-finite poses, missing head ⇒ hand reads UNTRACKED, never identity/raw fallback | pipeline gating tests |
| 5b | Yaw-latch guard | `engine.py` `_head_latchable` | NaN warm-up / looking-straight-down head samples never latch the session yaw frame (would poison every body-relative sample); fail closed until a sane head arrives | `test_engine_yaw_latch_skips_degenerate_head_samples` |
| 5c | **Anchor-jump guard** | `safety/anchor_guard.py` via `engine.py` | mid-session recenter / app restart / headset sleep moves the ORBIT stream anchors ⇒ the applied calibration is silently wrong. Coherent both-wrist discontinuity (or one wrist with the other untracked), and a > `blackout_s` stream blackout, LOCK follow + banner RECALIBRATE; single-hand glitches (common, measured 0.2–1.5 m) hold ≤ `confirm_frames` then resume, never trip | `tests/test_anchor_guard.py` (17 tests) |
| 6 | Engage glide | `ClutchMapper` | target equals current EE at engage; absolute correspondence reached over `engage_blend_s` | `test_absolute_position_glides_to_chest_correspondence` |
| 7 | Workspace box | `arm_control.py` | EE targets clamped to `safety.workspace` (base frame) | motion tests |
| 8 | Anti-cross guard | `arm_control.py` | each hand pinned to its own side of world-Y ⇒ arms can never collide at the midline | `test_calibration_aligns_forward_and_no_cross` |
| 8b | Hand min-separation | `safety/separation.py` via `engine.py` | the two wrist targets (or a parked arm's actual wrist) kept ≥ `safety.hand_min_separation` apart in 3D — clapped hands meet at contact distance, never interpenetrate | `tests/test_neutral_calib.py` separation + clap tests |
| 9 | Soft joint limits + elbow floor | `arms/ik.py` | home ± measured-workspace margins; j3 floor prevents hyperextension | `test_limit_margins_and_within_limits` |
| 10 | j6 roll saturation | `arms/ik.py` swing–twist | roll beyond the ±120° motor range pins j6 gracefully; NEVER smeared onto j4/j5 | `test_roll_beyond_j6_range_saturates_without_contortion` |
| 11 | IK velocity budget | `arms/ik.py` | per-joint `ik.max_vel`, derated ×`hardware.max_vel_scale` on run_hw | run_hw derate print |
| 12 | **Command shaper** | `safety/shaper.py` @ `HardwareSink` | every CAN command limit-clamped to the PHYSICAL hardstops, speed-capped (`hardware.rate_limit`), critically-damped PD smoothing, init from measured pose, NaN ⇒ hold | `tests/test_shaper.py` (6 tests) |
| 13 | Motor-side backstops | YAM firmware | MIT-mode PD + 400 ms motor watchdog (commands stop ⇒ motors stop) | hardware-day check |

Order matters: 1–5 decide *whether* to follow, 6–11 decide *where* to go, 12–13
bound *how fast anything can physically move* no matter what upstream does.

## Sim→Real Checklist (the Linux hardware day)

The Mac never talks to motors; the Linux host runs the SAME engine with the
HardwareSink. In order:

1. **Host prep**: Ubuntu, `sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000`
   (and can1), `uv pip install -e i2rt`, ORCA hands tensioned/calibrated.
2. **Gate**: `uv run python scripts/verify_stack.py` on the Linux host (everything
   that passes on the Mac must pass there).
3. **Static**: power arms in a clear volume at the rest pose. Start
   `scripts/dashboard.py` on the host; confirm stream + joint angles.
4. **Keyboard jog first — no headset**: `scripts/jog_arms.py --sink hw`. Single
   joint ±3°, every joint, both arms; then EE nudges. Confirm: motion direction
   matches the dashboard/sim, speed feels like the shaper cap (`rate_limit` 1.2
   rad/s default — slow), hardstops respected. THIS is the sim→real transfer
   check, with your hand on the e-stop.
5. **Replay on hardware**: `run_hw --vr replay recordings/roll_right.npz`
   — a session you have already watched in sim, now on metal. No surprises
   allowed: same motion, slower (derated).
6. **Live teleop, gesture clutch**: `run_hw --vr orbit --clutch gesture`.
   Engage one hand at a time. Verify dropout HOLD by covering a hand; verify
   deadman by un-pinching; verify Ctrl+C releases torque.
7. Only then consider raising `hardware.max_vel_scale` / `rate_limit`
   incrementally.

Known unknowns to verify on metal (cannot be tested here): CAN bus latency under
both arms + hands, YamArm 5-vs-6 motor enumeration padding (see
`arms/yam_driver.py` docstring), ORCA serial throughput, thermal behavior.

## What Is Deliberately NOT Here

- No MuJoCo at runtime (`scripts/check_no_mujoco_runtime.py` enforces it).
- No stance/orientation calibration — attitude mapping is fixed-convention
  (the guided POSITION calibration is the only per-session fit; see contracts).
- No hand-rolled Jacobian solvers — position/swing are pink QP diff-IK; the only
  analytic step is the exact 1-DoF j6 twist assignment.
